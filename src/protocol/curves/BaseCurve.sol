 * @title  BaseCurve

 * @notice Abstract contract for a bonding curve. Defines the interface for converting assets to shares and vice versa.
 * @dev This contract is designed to be inherited by other bonding curve contracts, providing a common interface for
 *      converting between assets and shares.
 * @dev These curves handle the pure mathematical relationship for share price. Pool ratio adjustments (such as
 *      accomodating for the effect of fees, supply burn, airdrops, etc) are handled by the MultiVault instead
 *      of the curves themselves.
